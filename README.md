A few words:
1. The website is updated each year by the Residence Tutor (RT) responsible for Hall IT Business, and this legacy is passed to the next RT.
2. As you can tell, the development process involves multiple authors. I am only one of the many who suffered climbing through the mess.
3. I am the responsible RT during 2021-2022.
4. I proposed a MUCH MUCH MUCH cleaner solution, but it didn't pass. So we are gonna use this heritage sadly for at least a couple of years to come.

GOOD LUCK TO THE NEXT GUY HANDLING THIS. 

Don't pass out when you see thousands of lines of HTML and comments - these were passed to me as well. Just BREATHE.

Good luck my friend.
