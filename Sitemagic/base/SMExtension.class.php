/// <container name="base/SMExtension">
/// 	Base class for all extensions running within the application. Extensions must inherit from
/// 	SMExtension in order to work.
///
/// 	Extensions are found in the extensions folder on the server. Each extension is installed
/// 	in its own subfolder. The name of the folder becomes the internal name of the extension
/// 	used throughout the system.
/// 	To allow an extension to participate in the life cycle, a file named Main.class.php must
/// 	be found in the extension folder. This file must define a class inheriting from SMExtension.
/// 	The class must have the exact same name as the folder in which it resides - the name of
/// 	the extension.
///
/// 	An instance of SMContext is available through $this->context, providing access to the
/// 	underlaying template, form element and more. See base/SMContext for more information.
///
/// 	Extensions enabled will have their life cycle functions executed. The functions allow each
/// 	extension to interact with the application and other extensions during different stages of the
/// 	life cycle. Simply override a life cycle function to add functionality.
///
/// 	An extension may prepare data or add functionality to the application during e.g. PreInit, which
/// 	may be consumed by other extensions during Init or later.
///
/// 	Each stage of the life cycle is executed for all extensions enabled, before the next stage
/// 	is started. The life cycle is executed in the following order:
///
/// 	1) PreInit
/// 	2) Init
/// 	-- Application makes design template (SMTemplate) and form instance (SMForm) available to extensions
/// 	3) InitComplete
/// 	4) PreRender
/// 	5) Render (only executed by privileged extension)
/// 	6) RenderComplete
/// 	7) PreTemplateUpdate
/// 	-- System adds Form element to template
/// 	-- System adds output from privileged extension to template
/// 	8) TemplateUpdateComplete
/// 	9) PreOutput
/// 	-- Place holders and repeating blocks not replaced are removed
/// 	-- Template including changes is written to client
/// 	10) OutputComplete
/// 	11) Unload
/// 	--- Uncommitted data sources are committed (including SMAttributes)
/// 	12) Finalize
///
/// 	Notice that the application allows only one extension to construct output to the content area.
/// 	This is done by the privileged extension which returns the desired output from the Render()
/// 	function. The privileged extension is determined by the query string parameter SMExt.
/// 	E.g. index.php?SMExt=SMLogin renders the login dialog from the SMLogin extension in the
/// 	content area.
///
/// 	Other extensions may manipulate the output using the instance of SMTemplate accessible
/// 	through $this->context->GetTemplate(). See base/SMTemplate for more information.
///
/// 	An extension being executed privileged may be executed in two different modes.
/// 	- Shared execution mode allow other extensions to participate in the life cycle (most common)
/// 	- Dedicated execution mode results in only privileged extension being executed. This is mainly
/// 	used when the extension needs to display something in a pop up window, and does not depend
/// 	on other extensions. Override GetExecutionModes() to enable support for dedicated execution mode.
///
/// 	$this->context->GetExecutionMode() will reveal current execution mode.
/// 	See base/SMExecutionMode for more information.
