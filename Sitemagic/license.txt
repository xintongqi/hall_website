The following limitations apply:

 - You can not create derivatives (e.g. fork it)

   unless subject to alternative license (e.g. TinyMCE).

 - Codemagic retains full copyright and ownership
   of Sitemagic CMS.


Basically we honour the first 3 rules from the
Free Software Definition defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
http://www.fsf.org

 - The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.

 - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it
   so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the
   source code is a precondition for this.

 - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

 - *The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
   others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
   to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
   precondition for this.

 * Although we do not allow distribution of modified (forked) copies,
   we highly encourage users and developers to participate with
   development of new extensions and design templates.
   Developers are welcome to apply different licensing
   terms to their own code - also the full FSF license.


The purpose of this license is to ensure control with the
development, and most importantly, quality of Sitemagic CMS.
